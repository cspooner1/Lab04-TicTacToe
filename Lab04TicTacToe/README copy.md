Lab 4

This Tic Tac Toe game is a two-player console game implemented in C#. The game allows two players to take turns marking positions on a 3x3 grid. Each player is assigned a marker, 'X' or 'O', and the objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marker before the grid is fully occupied. The players enter their names at the beginning, and the game displays the board with numbered slots for them to choose where to place their marker. After each move, the game checks for a winner or a draw. The game continues until one player wins or the board is filled without a winner. The winner is then announced, or if there's no winner, it's declared a draw.
